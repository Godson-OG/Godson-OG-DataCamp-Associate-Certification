# Associate Data Analytics Certification by DataCamp - Godson OG

##### Here are the steps I took to get certified as an Associate Data Analyst by Datacamp in Sept, 2022.

The exam has two different segments, which are;

1. Written Exam
2. Case Study

### Written Exam

In this segment you'd be writing 4 different sections of about 20-25 questions, which are;
1) Data Management in SQL (SQL)
2) Exploartory Analysis Theory (Based majorly on Data Visualization course by DataCamp)
3) Exploratory Analysis in SQL (SQL)
4) Statistical Experimentation Theory (Based majorly on Intro to Statistics course by DataCamp)

#### Tips on Scaling SQL: 
1) All SQL exams are majorly based off Postgres so its advised to practice on Postgres to avoid making mistakes while writing the queries.
2) Practice Database and Queries using Strata Scratch (They have a Postgres option which would help you practice better).
3) Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/techTFQ/playlists"> Tech TFQ's </a> videos on Youtube, he has amazing content on SQL intermediate and advanced SQL queries.
4) Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/tu_babs"> Tu_bab </a> on Twitter, he drops amazing content on SQL and it can help you be better at SQL.

#### Tips on Scaling other segments:
1) Take the *Visualization for everyone* course by DataCamp, that'd be able to solve segment 2
2) Take the *Introduction to Statistics* course by DatCamp, that'd help you scale most of the Questions that come in Segment 4
3) Make researches on different topics to get deeper insights and better understanding of most topics.

#### General Tips:
1) Exhaust their assessment chances, you might see new insights from those test questions and they'd give you a feeling of how the questions feel like.

### Case Study

##### Congratulations on passing the first step, which might literally be the hardest step off the 2.

Here you'd be given a dataset to clean/validate, analyze and visualize your results. The upside is that you can use any tool like SQL and Excel, Python and so on. I personally used Python because I was very comfortable and confident using it as an analysis and visualization tool.
